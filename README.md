The dataset consists of 40 images, each category consisting 20 hand-drawn images. I have used "P" and "Q" to experiment with the model.

#### Why so small dataset?

The purpose of this dataset was to learn and experiment. This model can be used for any existing dataset for Binary Image Classification

## How to use the code?

1. Download and prepare your training data
2. Use any of the file (.py or .ipynb) to play around with the code
